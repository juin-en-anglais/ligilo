# ligilo

From the esperanto ```a tool to work with links```, ligilo is a zola theme designed to list all your links in a nice web page.

## Beware the dirt

Since I haven’t figured out how to fetch links in a normal use of markdown, ligilo uses markdown in a non-standard way. To create a link, you’ll need to write the title ```## like this``` and the address ```### https://like.this/```. This is really dirty and non-standards compliant.
